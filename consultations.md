**Consultations are free.**

Everyone is different. We will assess you, ask some simple questions and create a bespoke plan just
for you. We aim to achieve the look you desire.
If you have concerns or questions we will try our best to answer them.
During consultation the practitioner will discuss
- Your medical history
	- This will include a detailed medical history, any medications you are taking and any
allergies you may have
- Your expected outcome
	- We will discuss the areas you have concern over and create a bespoke treatment
plan to help achieve the results you want

- Potential risks and side effects
	- It is important you are aware of any risks or side effects of the treatments you are
given
- Aftercare advice
	- We will advise on what you can do to make sure the treatment is as effective as
possible and give detailed information on what to do after having treatment.

- Answer any questions

	- We will allow you the opportunity to ask any questioned regarding treatment and give
you time to make a considered decision about whether treatment is right for you. We
recommend you take a minimum of 24 hours to consider the pros and cons before
making a decision and booking an appointment for treatment.
