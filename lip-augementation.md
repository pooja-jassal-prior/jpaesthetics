### Which fillers do you use?
We only use premium fillers, they are safe and effective. We will discuss at consultation the best filler choice for you. 


### What happens if I change my mind?
They first time you have lip fillers before it can be a daunting decision and its natural to worry that you may not like the final result. Rest assured if you were not 100 % happy the product can be removed by a dissolvent (Hyalase).

### Will it hurt?
We apply a topical anaesthetic to numb your skin. We can use local anaesthetic, just like a at the dentist, if you want complete numbness. We aim to provide treatment with minimal discomfort. 

After a treatment, the local anaesthetic will probably make your lips feel numb for about 4 to 6 hours.

### How long do dermal fillers last? 
Most dermal fillers last between six to 18 months. This can be affected by how your body responds and the type of filler used. 

### Are there any side effects?
Temporary side effects following treatment include swelling, tenderness and redness.
